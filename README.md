# statistical_analysis_test_AB
This repository presents my skils on data wrangling and statistical analysis of a test AB results. 

## Project Objectives: 
Identify the 10 most popular travel destinations.
Analyse the number of trips per transportation company.
Estimate the correlation between trip duration from Loop to O'Hare using a hypothesis test.

## Analysis Process Description: 

The dataset consists of three tables: moved_project_sql_result_01, moved_project_sql_result_04, and moved_project_sql_result_07. The tables will be initially imported and inspected. Missing values, duplicates, and data types will then be cleaned and corrected. Once the data is prepared through descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, the analysis objectives will be addressed, and conclusions will be drawn.

## Conclusions of the Analysis
The analysis identified the 10 most popular travel destinations and the 10 companies with the highest number of recorded trips during the period from November 15 to 16, 2017.

The most popular destination was Loop, with an average of over 10,000 trips to that location.

The most popular company was Flash Cab, with more than 19,000 trips recorded.

Finally, the analysis also revealed that rain significantly affects the duration of trips between Loop and Oâ€™Hare. The average trip duration in rainy conditions was found to be nearly twice as long as in good weather.
